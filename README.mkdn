What is SteelBox?
----------------
SteelBox is a modified version of CMParts.  It contains fixes for the device that its included with, and designed to be easy to use, and catagorized so that the user doesnt spend a lot of time looking for the settings they want.  SteelBox has been compressed, optimized, and zipaligned to provide the best experience possible at the smallest size.
